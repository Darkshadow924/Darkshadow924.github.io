I performed two dataset of Network Intrusion Detection and IoT Device Network Logs for improving detecting intrusion using machine learning algorthim for my thesis project. Download the Two dataset namely Network Intrusion Detection and IoT Device Network Logs, which links are provided in report. Then updoad the dataset to google drive for perfom the excution code for this project. Here there will be link at top in both data (Network Intrusion Detection and IoT Device Network Logs ) for permission to excute and test the code on google Colab. Define the paths to dataset files in google drive and start running code.
