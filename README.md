I performed two dataset of Network Intrusion Detection and IoT Device Network Logs for improving detecting intrusion using machine learning algorthim for my thesis project. Downloaded the Two dataset namely Network Intrusion Detection and IoT Device Network Logs. Then updoaded the dataset to google drive for perfom the excution code for this project. There will be link in both data (Network Intrusion Detection and IoT Device Network Logs ) for permission to excute and test the code on google Colab. Define the paths to dataset files in google drive and start running code.
